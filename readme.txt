This is a (hopefully) simple sketch for translating text input into 
morse code which is displayed across nine leds.

The hardware consists of four sets of two yellow leds. One lit led represents a dot, two a dash.
The ninth red led is currently used for spaces and unrecognized characters (the system currently only recognizes capital letters).

The sketch has a decent amount of commenting so hopefully it will be easy to follow and improve upon.
